File Processing

File processing in Python refers to the operations performed on files, such as creating, reading, writing, updating, and deleting content. It is essential for managing data stored in files efficiently. Python provides built-in functions like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` for file handling, and the `with` statement ensures proper resource management.
